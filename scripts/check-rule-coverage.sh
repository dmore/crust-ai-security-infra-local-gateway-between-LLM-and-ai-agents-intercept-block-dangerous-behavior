#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-rule-coverage.sh - Verify each security rule has test and fuzz coverage
#
# This script extracts all rule names from security.yaml and verifies each rule:
# 1. Has a COVERS marker in fuzz_test.go (fuzz coverage)
# 2. Has its name mentioned in test files (unit test coverage)
#
# It also warns about orphaned COVERS markers for deleted rules.
#
# To add coverage for a rule:
#   1. Add fuzz seeds and marker: // COVERS: rule-name
#   2. Add unit test that mentions the rule name
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - All rules have coverage
#   1 - Some rules are missing coverage
